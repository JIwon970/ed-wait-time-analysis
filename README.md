# Emergency Department Wait Time Analysis

This project analyzes Emergency Department (ED) waiting time patterns using a fully synthetic dataset. The goal is to demonstrate an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Excel, SQL, and Power BI.

## Tools Used
- Excel
- Power Query
- Pivot Tables
- SQL
- Power BI

## Key KPIs (Excel Dashboard)
- Average Wait Time: 41.0 min  
- Median Wait Time: 39 min  
- Max Wait Time: 119 min  
- Total Patients: 6,000  
- Average Peak Hour Wait Time: 39.9 min  

## Key Insights
- The average ED waiting time is approximately 41 minutes, with extreme cases reaching up to 119 minutes.  
- Peak-hour congestion does not significantly increase average wait time compared to off-peak periods.  
- Higher triage levels (4–5) are associated with substantially longer waiting times.
